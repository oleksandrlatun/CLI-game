You are Elyra, a wanderer trapped in a living maze.

You wake up in a place that is both endless and closed in.
Stone paths go in every direction—toward forests, swamps, ruins, deserts, and dark halls.
The walls whisper:

***_“Find three true keys… only then will the door open.”_***

You don’t know how you got here.
You only know this: the maze is alive.
It tries to trick you with wrong paths, traps, and lies. Some ways lead nowhere. Some hide secrets. But three real keys exist, and only they can open the way to freedom.

- ***Your tools:*** the command line.
- ***Your map:*** your memory.
- ***Your hope:*** to keep going.

The maze is watching.
The maze is waiting.
***Can you escape?***

## 🕹️ How to Play

You explore the maze using terminal commands, just as if you were navigating a real filesystem.

## Movement

* ```ls``` → list available paths or items in the current location.

* ```cd <direction>``` → move into that path (e.g., cd north/cave).

* ```cd ..``` → go back one step.

* ```pwd``` → show where you currently are in the maze.

## Reading Clues

* ```cat <file>``` → read notes, hints, or warnings.

* Pay close attention! Clues may point you in the right direction… or lead you astray.

## Collecting Keys

* ```cp keyX.txt <destination>``` → copy a key into the exit chamber (you should fins it).

* Only three true keys will unlock the exit.

* Fake keys (like the one in the dungeon) will be rejected.

## Goal

* Deliver all three real keys into the exit/ folder.

* Once all are there, check the lock with cat lock.txt.

* If successful, freedom awaits!

## Warnings

* Some paths are ***traps*** or ***illusions***. They waste time, but may also contain clues.

* Notes, ruins, and warnings are not always direct—interpret carefully.

## 🎯 Victory Condition

* When all three keys are placed in a chamber exitt and the lock accepts them, the door opens.
<!-- /east/tunnel/chamber/exit/ -->
* You will see a message of triumph:

🎉 Congratulations, you escaped the maze with the true keys!
